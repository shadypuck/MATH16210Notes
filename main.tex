\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{1/12:}Upper limit at signing up for 4-5 across the script.
    \item Lemma \ref{lem:6.2} is probably more straightforward using a contradiction argument.
    \item Briefly restate the algebra of Exercise \ref{exr:4.24} in Exercise \ref{exr:6.3c}.
    \item \marginnote{1/14:}Turning in Script \ref{sct:5} journals is optional --- it will boost your grade a bit if you do.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Your journal grade will be whichever is higher: the average of all your journal grades with and without Script \ref{sct:5}.
        \item Script \ref{sct:5} will probably be due Wednesday, 1/20.
    \end{itemize}
    \item In Lemma \ref{lem:6.6}, do we need to prove that the union of arbitrarily many Dedekind cuts is, itself, a Dedekind cut? Yes.
    \item \marginnote{1/18:}Is there a way to prove something else besides $A$ is not open in Exercise \ref{exr:6.7}?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is probably it as far as proving that continuua are connected.
        \item It may not be possible to prove that \emph{any} of the statements are wrong, but he's not sure.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Is Lemma \ref{lem:6.9} used in the proofs of any subsequent results, or is it just a less important result (hence the lemma designation)?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We can think of it as an alternate definition for density --- we could prove Definition \ref{dfn:6.8} from it.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Is my handwavey use of Scripts \ref{sct:2} and \ref{sct:3} ok in Corollary \ref{cly:6.12}?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I'm fine.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Is there a simpler way to prove Corollaries \ref{cly:6.12} and \ref{cly:6.14}?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item hi
    \end{itemize}
    \item Is the math REU still running this summer?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He's not sure; UChicago's may not be NSF approved, hence why its not on the website rn.
    \end{itemize}
    \item What other summer opportunities would you recommend for a student at my level?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He did an REU at UWisconsin when he was an undergrad.
        \item Sounds like its pretty much just REUs for undergrads.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
